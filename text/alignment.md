# Talent Alignment

An engineering manager has an immense amount of responsibility. He is responsible to advance the career of all of its developers at any given moment in time. If your developers are not constantly improving and advancing their career then they will look for other engineering managers that do give them the opportunity to advance their career. 

This issue is often overlooked as time passes by because it's easy to ignore. As an engineering manager, you will need to analyze the career path of all of your developers and make sure that what they are in one year from now is an improved version of what they are today - both from a resume perspective and a literal perspective.

As you manage more and more developers, it's easier to lose focus on some, especially those who are quiet. Therefore, you will need to plan regular career check-ups every 3 months to one year to ensure that people are happy with their career path.

A good framework for doing talent management is as follows:

1. Schedule a career expectations meeting, in which you would ask the question: where do you want to be one year from now?
2. Once a quarter, make sure that reality aligns with the expectations
3. Throughout the year, make sure that you are fully aware of the career aspirations of all of your developers, so you can adjust the teams and pick the right people for the right job according to their needs.

Sometimes you will need to make decisions that seem less optimal to the company by following the third point, but the reality is that if people will stay for longer, they will increase the morale of the rest of the organization, gain more expertise and require the business to invest less in extra recruiting - which means that it can eventually pan out as the more optimal decision. 

For example, a developer who wants to learn Scala will need twice as much time to develop a system than his counterpart who already knows Scala. But for you, the extra week of investment is worth it just for the sake of making your employees happy, not even considering the fact that learning Scala can be useful for his future in the company as well.

"Maslow's hierarchy of needs" is a psychological theory proposed back in 1943 by Abraham Maslow. The theory talks about the leves and phases of personal development of a person's career in life. It starts out with the physiological needs (e.g. food, water, sleep), safety, love/belonging, esteem and finally self-actualization - in that order. People will first focus their career and worry about being able to eat, before they care about how much they feel appreciated in their workplace.

Most people in the world who work at simple, repetitive jobs, get stuck before self-actualization. In the software development world however, most people reach the need for self-actualization. They want to realize their full potential and prove that they can become the most they can be. As engineering managers, we have to enable them to realize their full potential.

Generally speaking, there are several ways of growing:

1. Management - probably the most obvious one, and sometimes wrongfully seems like the only way to advance one's career. Moving into management means learning a new skillset which focuses on how people work rather than how software works. People often are attracted to management as it is perceived as having more responsibility and power over people. A manager's time often can be considered more "valuable", which means people can be more appreciated and get paid more. Management is sometimes also considered as a more future-proof skill as we age, because it relies more on experience rather than agility, speed and learning ability.
2. Technical Skills - developers like to learn new things and increase their toolset and abilities. Learning is not only fun, but the more we learn new things, the better we get at being developers in general, as we gain new perspectives. Technical skills also put developers at a relative advantage over other developers, which leads to becoming more needed, and ultimately getting paid more and being more appreciated.
3. Entrepreneurship / Business Impact - entrepreneurs look at software development as a means to an end. The impact is eventually what matters, not the successful execution of the project. Such people will often enjoy working on systems that have greater impact rather than managing more people or learning more programming languages.
4. Hobbies - some people don't look at their workplace as their growth path in life at all, and only care about developing their hobbies outside of work. These people are actually the easiest to handle as they do not require career development at all. As long as they are happy in their current role, they should just stay there.

As an engineering manager, you should identify which avenues are the growth paths for your employees, and work using these assumptions. Often times your employees will realize they have not fully thought through what they want to achieve in life, so more frequent 1 on 1 meetings will be required until they actually feel comfortable with their career aspirations.
