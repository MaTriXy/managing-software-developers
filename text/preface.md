# Preface - Why is managing developers hard?

Managing software development teams has become a profession of its own. But, unlike software development or business school, there wasn’t a point in time where the world stopped to think for a second and realize this profession can and should be thought. In fact - the world is still in a constant state of guesswork and on-job-training for management. The only way to actually learn how to manage software developers today - is to try.

But after you try, how do you know that you’re doing a good job? The first thing I noticed about managing developers is that it requires a lot of effort, much more than I have originally anticipated. But the worse part is that unlike software development - where you can quantify if a developer is doing a good job pretty easily - quantifying the success of a software manager is much harder. And if you know what makes a software development manager good, then you will be able to improve, as a manager.

This book is about sharing the things I have learned managing software developers, software team leaders, software tech leads and software project managers, as part of my journey - from starting a company, hiring the first employees, promoting them, selling the company to a large enterprise, and operating within it, while continuing to build the team.

In this book, I will aim to give you some tools so that you could answer questions like:

* How do you make your employees happy?
* How much do you invest in writing software?
* How do you estimate efforts and meet deadlines?
* How do you operate in an environment where product requests constantly change and employees give variable output?
* How do you scale your team?
* How do you test your software?
* Which technologies should you choose that best fit the team?

The chapters in the book are not ordered by a specific ordering. This book is more of a “handbook” rather than a story - although I will give stories and examples from time to time from my past experience. I hope you will enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it!
